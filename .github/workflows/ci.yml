      # Note: For sticky comments to work effectively with NX Monorepos,
      # we usually need to aggregate coverage or test reports.
      # For now, let's keep it simple: if tests fail, we see it in the Action logs.
      # To add sticky comments for coverage later, we need to configure Vitest
      # to output a summary.json and parse it.
